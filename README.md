*DESCRIPTION*: # Real-Time Chat Application ðŸ’¬

This is a real-time chat application where users can send and receive messages instantly. It works just like any online chat platform where messages appear without needing to refresh the page. I built this project as a part of my internship task to learn and practice front-end and back-end development using modern tools and technologies.

For the **frontend**, I used **React.js** to build a clean and responsive user interface. React helped me update the messages on the screen in real-time whenever a user sends or receives a new message.

For the **backend**, I used **Node.js** with **Express.js** to handle the server-side logic. I also used **WebSocket (Socket.IO)** to enable real-time communication between users. Socket.IO helps to create a two-way connection between the client and server, allowing messages to be sent and received instantly.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.IO  
- **Other Tools:** Visual Studio Code, npm (Node Package Manager)

This project helped me understand how real-time messaging works, how to manage server and client connections, and how to create interactive user interfaces.
